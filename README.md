# NTFS_Tools
This is a collection of programs and scripts that has helped me and is helping me to expand the NTFS driver for ReactOS

Most of these programs were created during my Google Summer of Code projects in 2016 and 2017. The goal of both summers was to add write support to ReactOS' NTFS driver. While I was able to add folder and file creation, two summers wasn't enough to achieve everything that could be considered write support, like file deletion and renaming.

These "bonus" programs were previously hosted on Amazon Web Services, but I wanted to put them here on Github because I think it's a better place for them to be hosted, especially since I plan to start expanding them. Also, it's free.

These are mostly here as an archive for myself, but it's possible others may find them useful. Note that because I wrote them for myself and for very specific purposes, the code and interfaces are typically of much lower quality than what I would consider "production quality."

It should go without saying but running any of these programs is done <strong>at your own risk</strong>. Many of them manipulate your hard drive at the byte-level and may erase all your data, either by design or accident.
